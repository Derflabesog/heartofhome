        Building your first home is an exciting milestone, but it requires proper planning to avoid costly surprises. This guide helps Namibian families navigate the process and avoid common mistakes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">1. Know Your Budget (Really)</h2>
      <p>
        Your total cost isn't just the building quote. Always factor in a contingency fund (10-15%) for unexpected costs. Material prices can fluctuate, and unforeseen site issues can arise. Also, remember to budget for municipal fees, connection fees (water/electricity), and landscaping.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">2. Understand Your Soil & Foundation</h2>
      <p>
        This is the most critical part of your house. A cheap foundation is a recipe for future disaster. In many parts of Namibia, rock-face foundations are a durable and cost-effective solution. Always insist on a proper soil assessment before finalizing foundation plans.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">3. Plan for Future Extensions</h2>
      <p>
        Your family might grow. Even if you're building a smaller starter home, think about where a future garage, extra bedroom, or outdoor "braai" area could go. Planning for this now makes future extensions much cheaper and easier.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">4. Safety First</h2>
      <p>
        While some DIY work can save money (like painting or tiling), never compromise on structural or electrical work. Always use certified professionals for critical tasks to ensure your home is safe and compliant with regulations.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-4 border-t border-gray-200">5. Get Professional Guidance</h2>
      <p>
        Hiring an experienced, engineer-led team might seem more expensive upfront, but it saves you a fortune in the long run by preventing mistakes, ensuring quality, and managing the project efficiently.
